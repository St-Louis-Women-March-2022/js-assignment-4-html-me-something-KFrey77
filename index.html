   <p>Plague doctors originated in the 1620s in France, during a second pandemic of the bubonic plague, known as the Black Plague.
   The bubonic plague started much easlier, in the 1300s, but it began to spread with a new resurgance in the 1600s. 
   Plague doctors were not really doctors in the tradicitional sense - they had no medical training, and would often just use blood letting and leeches to try to
   treat the swollen lymph nodes (buboes). Beyond that, some of them just took inventory of deaths for the census.</p>
   <p1>The plague doctor costume is, for the most part, a medieval version of modern PPE. The long beaked masks contained sweet smelling substances like lavender, peppermint,
   or berries. This would protect them from the smell of the plague and all the death around them, as they believed one could get sick from 'bad air,' or 'evil smells,'
   known as the miasma theory. The masks also included small holes in the beak to allow them to breathe, and eye holes with pieces of glass covering them. 
   They also wore wide brimmed hats, gloves, and heavy robes, and most of them carried a cane. The can was used to examine people without touching them, and also for 
   self defense.</p1></main>

   <p>Unfortunately, the masks and other things the plague doctors wore usually didn't work, and many of them died, along with much of the population. 
      The ones that didn't were outcasted by society, and were regarded as <em>the stuff of nightmares</em>.</p></div>

         <h2>The Stuff of Nightmares</h2>
         </article></div>
         
      <b><p3>People in the gothic subculture love all things macabre, dark, romantic, and, dare I say, <em>nightmarish.</em> The movie, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is very popular
      among people in this subculture and adjacent ones, so it's no wonder we would latch onto plague doctors as some kind of gothic icon. They became especially relevant when
      the current pandemic started. I feel that using plague doctors was a way to try to persuade people to wear their masks and get the vaccines, in a way that fit right in with 
      those who felt possibly a little cut off from their alternative friends and events for folks who participated in the sect. I, for one, have a plague doctor mask, a pin, a
      plushie, a t-shirt, a homemade figurine, earrings, and a tattoo, all plague doctor themed. I suppose, to me, they represent protection from illness or injury, in their own unique
      way. It's how I have been coping with the pandemic (or at least one of the ways) in a way that makes sense to me.</p3></b>
